HEAPS
A heap is a tree-based data structure,it can be either a max-heap tree ,where the parent node is greater than the children or a min-heap tree where the parent node is smaller than the children.

Advantages
Heaps can be  implemented as array
The elements in a heap are easily accessible
Heaps allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements

Disadvantages
Less memory management 
It lacks flexibility

Heaps properties
All levels in a heap should be full
They are implemented in an array
The nodes of a heap must be arranged in an order according to values,they should follow the min-heap or max-heap property.

Application of binary trees
Used in file system
Database system

Accessing items in a heap
Adding items
heappush() is used to insert elements to the heap 

Removing items
heappop() function is used to remove the element at the first index.



TUPLES
Tuples allow for the storage of several objects in a single variable.
They are ordered and unchangeable




STACKS
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the principle of Last In First Out (LIFO).

Advantages of Stacks
It gives you control over how memory is allocated and released.

Stack Operations
Push: Add an element to the top of a stack
Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack
IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
IsFull: Check if the stack is full
Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it


QUEUES
A queue is linear data structure that consists of a collection is of items that follow a first-in-first-out sequence.

Queue Operations
Enqueue: Adds an item from the back of the queue.
Dequeue: Removes an item from the front of the queue.
Front/Peek: Returns the value of the item in front of the queue without dequeuing (removing) the item.
IsEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty.
IsFull: Checks if the queue is full.
Display: Prints all the items in the queue.
