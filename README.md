HEAPS
A heap is a tree-based data structure,it can be either a max-heap tree ,where the parent node is greater than the children or a min-heap tree where the parent node is smaller than the children.

Advantages
Heaps can be  implemented as array
The elements in a heap are easily accessible
Heaps allows efficient insertion and deletion of elements

Disadvantages
Less memory management 
It lacks flexibility

Heaps properties
All levels in a heap should be full
They are implemented in an array
The nodes of a heap must be arranged in an order according to values,they should follow the min-heap or max-heap property.

Application of binary trees
Used in file system
Database system

Accessing items in a heap
Adding items
heappush() is used to insert elements to the heap 

Removing items
heappop() function is used to remove the element at the first index.
